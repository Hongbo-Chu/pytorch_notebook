#.pyi文件的作用
## `i`stand for interface!
<b>java中接口的定义：</b>
>An interface in the Java programming language is an abstract type that is used to specify a behaviour that classes must implement

<b>python typeshed仓库：</b>
>Each Python module is represented by a `.pyi` "stub". This is a normal Python file (i.e., it can be interpreted by Python 3), except all the methods are empty

由于python中没有接口的定义，所以。ipy应该是作者留下的extension.
